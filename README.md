# BigQuery Query Repository

This is a repository to hold SQL queries for BQ, allowing proper version control on queries, as well as a PR process for any changes.

This could also be used to enforce a policy whereby queries cannot be updated directly through the BQ web interface.  In that case this repository could leverage the BQ API to make updates as part of an automated deployment after PR merge.
